# Extreme-Temperatures
The code are created to globally investigate the spatial patterns of hot and cold extremes as well as diurnal temperature range (DTR). 

## Requirements

1. The project was implemented and tested in Python 3.7. The higher versions should work after minor modification.
2. Other common modules like numpy, scipy, mpl_toolkits, and matplotlib for visualization.
3. Raw data were accessed through Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform with JavaScript.


## Implementation Details

### Data Preparation
```
The data can be accessed through [Google Cloud Computing Platform](https://code.earthengine.google.com/3596a7d8f40f4195cf8102a0ce81ac3c)

The code is as follows:
1-extract-global-temperature.js

```
